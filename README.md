# AGNES
Legacy Business Reporting Application


This is a legacy application developed our business intelligence architect who developed in VB.  My contribution to this application was 
adding a new C# based project to the solution and having them work together.  As VB and C# are both in the .NET framework, these
two different types of projects can live in the same solution and they will work together.  <br />
My contribution to this solution was a project called AGNESCSharp.  This module is used by human resources to track attendance, occurrences, and Leave of Absences.
